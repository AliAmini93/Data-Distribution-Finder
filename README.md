# Data-Distribution-Finder
There are three buttons and two tabs in this application. The input file data is loaded by selecting the Browse button. Furthermore, every process may be viewed on the Log tab. In the About Application section, users may find the proper input format. After the data has been loaded, By hitting the Run button, the program examines the histogram of the input data for the best-fitted distribution.

The sums of squared errors associated with each distribution fitted on the input data histogram were ranked by this application. In the final output file, the corresponding fitting errors may be obtained. The output file also contains the data histogram and best-fitting distribution charts. Finally, these findings may be saved as an Excel spreadsheet.
